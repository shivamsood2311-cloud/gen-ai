Implementations of extractive and abstractive summarization

Experiments with LLM temperature settings and prompt engineering

Example scripts demonstrating API-based summarization

Evaluation of summary quality using metrics (ROUGE, BLEU)

🤖 LLM Temperature Experiments
Demonstrations of how the temperature parameter affects:

Creativity

Determinism

Output diversity

Side-by-side outputs for comparison

Notebook visualizations showing variation in response patterns

📊 NumPy & Matplotlib Examples
Core numeric processing using NumPy
